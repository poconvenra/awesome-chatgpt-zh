PTProtect DVD Anti-Rip Copy Protection software is based on a technology called Content Scramble System (CSS), which is a digital rights management (DRM) scheme that encrypts the data on a DVD. CSS was designed to prevent DVD players from playing discs that are not authorized by the DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA), which licenses the technology to manufacturers. However, CSS has been cracked by various software programs that can bypass the encryption and rip or copy the DVD content.
