# How to Use Autohotkey Bunny Hop Script for CS:GO
 
If you are a fan of **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** (CS:GO), you might have heard of the term **bunny hopping**. Bunny hopping is a technique that allows you to move faster and more unpredictably by jumping repeatedly and strafing in the air. It can give you an edge over your opponents, especially in competitive matches.
 
However, bunny hopping is not easy to master. It requires precise timing, coordination, and practice. That's why some players use a **script** to automate the process. A script is a piece of code that runs in the background and performs certain actions for you. In this case, a script can spam the spacebar for you, so you don't have to press it manually every time you land.

One of the most popular tools for creating and running scripts is **AutoHotkey**. AutoHotkey is a free and open-source software that allows you to create custom keyboard shortcuts, macros, and scripts for various purposes. You can use it to automate tasks, enhance your productivity, or improve your gaming experience.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use AutoHotkey bunny hop script for CS:GO. We will explain what the script does, how to install it, how to activate it, and how to customize it. We will also provide some tips and warnings on using the script safely and effectively.
 
## What Does the AutoHotkey Bunny Hop Script Do?
 
The AutoHotkey bunny hop script is a simple script that spams the spacebar for you when you hold it down. This way, you can jump continuously without having to release and press the spacebar again. The script also adjusts the jump timing based on your velocity, so you can maintain your speed and momentum.
 
The script works by using a loop function that checks the state of the spacebar key. If the key is held down, it sends a spacebar input every 20 milliseconds. If the key is released, it breaks the loop and stops sending inputs. You can toggle the script on and off by pressing F8 (or any other key you prefer).
